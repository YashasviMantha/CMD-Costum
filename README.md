# Python-Scripts
These are some of the Scripts that I wrote for stuff like marking and set-up.

`from _Dump import me`   -->  is the file for importing the inscript runnables

`me.mark("D")`           -->  for watermarking the script in DUMP's name

# AutoHotKey-Scripts
These are some of the `.ahk` scripts I wrote.

# Linux Command Implementation
These are the currently supported aliases that I have added for the `l` cut.

Docs:

`c`         -->     Goes up a dir (`cd ..`)

`clear`     -->     clears the screen

`ll`        -->     Lists the dir (Will change it to list)

`ls`        -->     Lists the dir (Will change it to rows)

# Terminal
These are some shorcuts (Aliases) that I have set which can be eaisly loaded onto the `.bashrc` file.

To use these clone the repo to your home directory and then copy the contents of the `__bashrc_copy__.sh` to your user `.bashrc` file.
Then execute the `source ~/.bashrc` to load all the commands.

Make sure to run `chmod +x *` in the terminal directory.

`o`         -->     Resets Proxy
